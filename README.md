This repository demonstrates a common error in Dockerfiles where the CMD instruction attempts to execute a file that is not correctly included in the image's filesystem. The issue is that the app.py file is referenced in the CMD instruction, but it may not be copied correctly or might not exist in the image's filesystem at runtime. The provided solution shows a corrected Dockerfile with a better way of handling this.
